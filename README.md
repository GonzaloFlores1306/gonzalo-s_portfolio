# [ðŸ˜ŠProject 1: Urban marathons over two centuries](https://github.com/GonzaloFlores1306/gonzalo-s_portfolio/blob/main/Projects/UM-Over-Two-Centuries/Project01_AnalizingTwoCenturiesUM.ipynb) 

This project consists of an exploratory analysis of historical data on urban marathons spanning more than two centuries.

## ðŸ¦¿Data was taken from the dataset ["TWO_CENTURIES_OF_UM_RACES"](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fatihyavuzz/two-centuries-of-um-races) in kaggle.com
## ðŸ”§Tools and Techgnologies used:
   * Programming language: Python
   * IDE: Jupyter Notebook (via Anaconda)
   * Libraries: Pandas and Seaborn
## Data Preprocessing and Cleaning:
   * Null Value Removal and Analysis
   * Conversion of Incorrect Data Types (integers, floats)
   * Column Renaming to Make Code Easier to Read
## Exploratory Analysis (EDA):
   * Filtering by events of specific distances (50km and 50mi)
   * Comparing Average Speeds between Men and Women over These Distances
   * Identifying Events in Which an Athlete Participated with a Specific ID
   * Visualizing the Distribution of Average Speeds, Participation by Gender, and More
## Visualizations:
   * Use of various graphs to compare and extract important data
## ðŸ§ Key questions answered:
  * In which events did an athlete with a specific ID participate?
  * What is the average speed difference between men and women in 50km and 50mi events?
  * What are the most common ages among runners? Who were the youngest and oldest to participate?
  * How does the number of finishers vary over time?
