# [🏃‍♂️ Project 1: Urban Marathons Over Two Centuries](https://github.com/GonzaloFlores1306/gonzalo-s_portfolio/blob/main/Projects/UM-Over-Two-Centuries/Project01_AnalizingTwoCenturiesUM.ipynb)

This project presents an **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** of historical urban marathon races spanning more than two centuries.

---

## 📦 Dataset
Data was sourced from the Kaggle dataset:  
🔗 [**Two Centuries of UM Races**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fatihyavuzz/two-centuries-of-um-races)

---

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Development Environment:** Jupyter Notebook (via Anaconda)  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib  

---

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing and Cleaning
- Removal and analysis of null values  
- Conversion of incorrect data types (e.g., integers, floats, strings to datetime)  
- Renaming of columns for improved readability and consistency  

---

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Filtering by specific race distances: **50km** and **50mi**  
- Comparison of **average speeds** between male and female participants  
- Identification of all events in which an athlete (by specific ID) participated  
- Ranking of participants by **age**: Top 15 youngest and oldest  
- General analysis of participation trends over time  

---

## 📊 Visualizations
- Histograms to visualize speed distributions  
- Bar charts comparing performance by gender and age  
- Line plots showing the evolution in the number of finishers over time  

---

## 🧠 Key Questions Answered
- In which events did an athlete with a specific ID participate?  
- What is the average speed difference between men and women in 50km and 50mi events?  
- What are the most common ages among runners? Who were the youngest and oldest participants?  
- How does the number of finishers change over the years?
